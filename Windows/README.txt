# These files provide a (hopefully portable) way to generate embossed 3D printed objects.
# They were developed for the Bits from Bytes BfB3000 printer, but judicious editing of new
# copies of the config, prefix and suffix files should be all that's required to get this to
# work for other Gcode-based printers.

#         This file!
# 
# Python script:
#     emboss.py
#         Use to generate the Gcode output files for the desired embossed object (Expects Python 2.7.x)
# 
# Test suite:
#     test_suite.sh
#         A Bash script to exercise the various options and test the parameter validation code
#         Also this generates a small selection of example output files.
# 
# Config files:
#     BfB3000_config.txt
#         Configuration parameters for a Bits from Bytes BfB3000 printer. Duplicate and edit for your machine.
#     BfB3000_prefix.txt
#         Initialise extruder/bed position, warm up (for ABS!), nozzle wipe routines prior to extrusion. Duplicate and edit for your machine.
#     BfB3000_suffix.txt
#         Home the extruder, cool down and lower the bed commands. Duplicate and edit for your machine.
